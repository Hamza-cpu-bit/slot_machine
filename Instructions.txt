IF you want to cheat run the game once and a file account_management.json will appear
it will look something like:
{
    "username": {
        "password": "your_password",
        "in_game_balance": 500,
        "money_account": 0,
        "daily_deposit": {
            "date": "2025-07-06"
        }
    }
}
you should add as many zero as yuu can in in game balance but dont change any other thing or the game will crash we will add GUI in v-1.2
